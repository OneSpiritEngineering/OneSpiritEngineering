One Spirit Engineering is a non-profit engineering organization formed for the purpose of engineering technological solutions for Developing Countries. What if kids learning 
technology could learn to solve their own economic problems?  What if kids living in depressed areas of American cities could learn to have hope and a future? We believe this is 
achieveable.
